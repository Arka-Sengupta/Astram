However, you may optimize this process by considering the following factors:\n\n1. **Loop Unrolling**: You can reduce the number of iterations in loops to improve cache performance and exploit hardware parallelism. This is done using loop unrolling where 2 or more iterations are executed at once which improves the efficiency. But keep in mind that it increases code complexity and should be used wisely.\n\n2. **Using Efficient Libraries**: Use libraries like numpy for python (which internally uses C/C++), TensorFlow, PyTorch etc., These libraries are highly optimized and provide good performance.\n\n3. **Prefetching & Pipelining**: Prefetch the data that is likely to be needed in future iterations or pipeline them so that you don't have to wait for a single long computation.\n\n4. **Parallel Computation**: Use parallel computing frameworks such as OpenMP, CUDA etc., which can significantly speed up the multiplication process.\n\n5. **Hardware Optimization**: Make use of hardware-specific instructions and directives if applicable.\n\n6. **Reducing Overheads**: Minimize the computation overhead by using well-designed algorithms like block matrix reduction or strassen's method etc.\n\nRemember, it depends on your specific needs for speed and memory usage to choose an optimized approach.
